        <p>The name is derived from the ancient <em>Veneti</em> people who inhabited the region by the 10th century BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to 1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important centre of commerceâ€”especially silk, grain, and spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. </p>
